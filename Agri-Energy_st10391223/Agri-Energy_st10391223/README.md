# Agri-Energy
	
IMPORTANT: DEAR MARKER:
I am writing to inform you that due to my extremely large project folder, I had to remove a lot of images and viewpages from my version of the web app on GitHub, I am unaware of who will be marking but I thought it would be helpful to let you know that the GitHub version I uploaded is missing images and views, I had to delete them to make space as my project was 88mb and only went down to 32mb compressed. Due to the size limit, I uploaded two project files, a zipped one on Arc with full functionality along with a YouTube link, and a running prototype on GitHub
